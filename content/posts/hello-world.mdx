Welcome to my blog. This is where I'll share what I learn about software engineering, design systems, and the tools I use.

## Why Write?

Writing helps me think. When I have to explain something, I understand it better. And if what I write helps someone else—even better.

## What to Expect

I'll write about:

- **Software engineering** — patterns, architecture, and lessons learned
- **Design systems** — building component libraries and maintaining consistency
- **Tools** — the editors, libraries, and workflows that make development easier

## A Code Example

Here's a simple TypeScript function:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

That's it for now. More soon.
