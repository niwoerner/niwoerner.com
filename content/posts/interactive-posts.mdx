Sometimes explanations work better with interactive examples. This post demonstrates how to combine prose with live playgrounds.

## The Split Section Pattern

The split section layout places explanatory text on the left and an interactive example on the right. On mobile, they stack vertically.

<SplitSection>
  <SplitContent>
    ### How State Works in React

    React components can have **state** — data that changes over time and triggers re-renders.

    The `useState` hook returns two things:
    1. The current value
    2. A function to update it

    When you call the setter function, React re-renders the component with the new value.

    Try clicking the buttons to see state in action.
  </SplitContent>
  <SplitPlayground>
    <CounterPlayground />
  </SplitPlayground>
</SplitSection>

## The Code Behind It

Here's the implementation of the counter playground:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export function CounterPlayground() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
      <div className="text-5xl font-bold">{count}</div>
      <div className="flex gap-2">
        <Button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c - 1)}>-1</Button>
        <Button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</Button>
        <Button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>+1</Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The key parts:

- `"use client"` marks this as a client component (needed for interactivity)
- `useState(0)` initializes the count at zero
- Each button calls `setCount` with a new value

## When to Use Split Sections

Split sections work well for:

- **Interactive demos** — let readers experiment with concepts
- **Code + output** — show code alongside its result
- **Before/after comparisons** — visualize changes side by side
- **Configuration examples** — adjust settings and see effects

They're less useful for:

- Long-form prose that needs full width
- Content that doesn't benefit from a visual aid
- Mobile-first content where stacking hurts the experience

## Creating Your Own

To add a split section to your posts:

```mdx
<SplitSection>
  <SplitContent>
    Your explanatory text here...
  </SplitContent>
  <SplitPlayground>
    <YourInteractiveComponent />
  </SplitPlayground>
</SplitSection>
```

The playground component must be:
1. Created in `components/playgrounds/`
2. Added to the `components` object in the post page
3. Marked with `"use client"` if it uses hooks or event handlers

That's it. Now you can build posts that teach through interaction.
